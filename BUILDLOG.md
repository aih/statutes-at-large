# BUILDLOG

One entry per session: what was asked, what was decided, what was verified.

## 2026-09-07 — stage 1: schema, repository, STATUTE loader

Asked: build stages 1 and 2 of the statutes API design in a new repository.

Done in this session by the main agent:

- Schema (`db/models.py`, migration `5afe43f05819`), the `Repository` protocol
  and its SQLAlchemy implementation, identifier parsing, `params.py`, the
  citation redirector, the app skeleton.
- The STATUTE volume loader with the section-7 identifier rules, the numbering
  pass for colliding law numbers, and the load report.
- Volumes 64 and 124 loaded into Postgres; reports in `docs/verification/`.
- 64 tests over SQLite and verbatim slices; `make test` and `make test-slow`
  green.

Decisions: ADR-0001 to ADR-0005.

Verified: `make test-all` (64 passed); `python -m ingest statute` over volumes
64, 72, 124, 137 (counts in `docs/verification/README.md`; 72 and 137 parsed
but not committed as reports because only 64 and 124 were asked for).
